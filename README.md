# CSC111_Final_Project
Program through which we have researched and analyzed how the graph data type can be used to find and plot routes for point-to-point travelling, making use of the Breadth First Search and Dijkstra's Algorithm..

This is a program that is centered around th eidea of Efficient Space Traversal. We make use of a graph-based data model to store locations in vertices (these may be
real world locations or just spaces customized by the user) allowing the software to work at different scales, from neighbourhood blocks to worldwide
commercial airline routes. The main goal throughout the creation of this project was to create a path finding tool using graphs which would allow for more
flecibility when it came to cutomizing the route the user desires to take. All of the data found in the datasets was manually input by us, the developers of this project,
meaning this project is more of a "proof of concept", but any dataset with the same structure as the one shown in the included datasets will work.

For instructions on how to run the program, please refer to the included "A Manual to Efficient Space Traversal" PDF file.
